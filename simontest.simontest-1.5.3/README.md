# SimonTest

## SimonTest is an Angular test generator.

It takes care of the most tedious part of testing components and services: mocking dependencies. This extension analyzes your code and creates the necessary stubs, configures the TestBed, and it even generates basic tests.

If you don't like writing boilerplate code then this extension is for you.

> _I absolutely love it! It makes writing unit tests for your Angular code a lot easier where it generates all the boilerplate code for you and you just have to write the specific tests you need._
