### Download PHP-CS-Fixer
This extension requires installation of the PHP-CS-Fixer library by SensioLabs. For more info see [their repo](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer#installation). Simply put, download the file using either Composer or the direct download (of the .phar file) and put it someplace nice and cozy on your machine.

This library is the bread and butter of the extension. It provides all the actual formatting logic. This extension is merely a wrapper to integrate it into VSCode.
