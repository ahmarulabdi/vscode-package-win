## Usage

#### Install the extension in VS Code

  * Open the command palette using Ctrl+Shift+P
  * Type `ext install apache` in the command palette

#### Select Apache conf as a language

  * On the bottom-right corner, click on the select language mode button, if you have created a new file it should display *Plain Text*.
  * Select *Apache* in the list of languages.

Alternatively, saving the file with a `.conf`, `.htaccess`, `.htgroups` or `.htpasswd` extension, will allow VS Code to understand that it is a Apache file, and automatically select the language correctly.

## Supported filetypes

  * .conf
  * .htaccess
  * .htgroups
  * .htpasswd
